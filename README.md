I'm a software engineer with expertise in mechanical engineering and industrial design. My focus is on developing and researching synthetic entities and interactive technologies for educational, therapeutic, and humanitarian purposes. As a freelancer, I provide full-stack development services for complex software solutions and specialize in intelligent robotics and design. My drive for engineering pushes me to find creative solutions for real-world problems, and I am constantly learning new techniques and best practices in programming, data structures, and algorithms.

<!--
- ðŸŒŒ Iâ€™m currently working on [Terbinari CBM project](https://github.com/ladooniani/terbinari). My research and development in computational logic and mechanics focused on invention and investigation of synthetic entity architecture, experimental and assistive educational, therapeutic, social, and humanitarian interactive and robotic technologies and concepts.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
 <!--- - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for support to expand independent research workflow, improve the laboratory environment, and speed up the conceptual strategy process, which leads to more involved research in frames of related technology, forming an educational platform for creative/intellectual collaboration, and search for other references. --->
