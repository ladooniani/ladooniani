### My name is [Lado Oniani](https://github.com/ladooniani/resume-cv/blob/main/README.md) 👋

 **ladooniani/ladooniani** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm a software engineer with expertise in mechanical engineering and industrial design. 

I create and research synthetic entities and interactive technologies for educational, therapeutic and humanitarian purposes. 

As a freelancer, I provide full-stack development services for complex software solutions and specialize in intelligent robotics and design. 

I aim to find creative solutions for real-world problems, constantly learning new techniques and best practices in programming, data structures, and algorithms. 

My goal is to make a positive impact through technology.

- 💬 Ask me about anything
 <!--- - 👯 I’m looking for support to expand independent research workflow, improve the laboratory environment, and speed up the conceptual strategy process, which leads to more involved research in frames of related technology, forming an educational platform for creative/intellectual collaboration, and search for other references. --->
